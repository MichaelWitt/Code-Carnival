    <h1>StoryTime Below</h1>
    <hr>
    
    <div class="tale">One day  <span class="name"></span> was walking down the street, and ran into a man who looked like a wizard! 
      He said he was going on a trip to <span class="country"></span> if they wanted to come along.
       <span class="name"></span> had always wanted to go there, and agreed to come.<br><br>
       When the man turned the street corner, there was a portal at the end of the road.
       They were transported, and told they could start a new life. A small <span class="color"> </span> cottage appeared, with a sign on the door that said "Welcome. You will begin
       your new job as a   <span class="job"> </span> tomorrow." <br><br>
       After going inside, it turned out someone was already living there.
        It was a pet <span class="animal"></span> named  <span class="animalName"></span>, who looked ecstactic 
       to have a new roommate.</div>
  <div class="tale">  One chilly evening in <span class="country"></span>,
     <span class="name"></span> went for a walk to grab a chocolate bar. Upon arriving
     at the candy store, <span class="name"></span> had a hard time deciding which one to pick. There were so many options!
     They decided to grab the candy with the <span class="color"> </span> wrapper.<br><br>
     After paying, it was time to walk home and snack. They greeted their pet <span class="animal"> </span>, named
     <span class="animalName"></span>. Once <span class="name"></span> ripped the wrapper off, there seemed to be something else inside.<br><br>
     It was a golden ticket to tour the chocolate factory, and a cash prize worth $100,000! "<span class="animalName"></span>, Can you believe this?
     We're going to be rich!", <span class="name"></span> exclaimed.</div>
     
     <div class="tale">  After a long day at work as a <span class="job"></span>,
      <span class="name"></span> packed up their briefcase and was ready to head home. <br> On the walk home,
       <span class="name"></span> noticed something strange flying in the sky. As it flew closer, they noticed
      it was a <span class="color"> </span> spaceship.<br><br>
      It lowered down on the street. Out popped an alien holding a <span class="animal"> </span>. The alien said, "
      Hi! My name is
      <span class="animalName"></span>, would you like to come with us?"  <span class="name"></span> thought for a quick second and hopped right in.<br>
      "Here goes nothing!" said <span class="name"></span></div>

      <div class="tale">  It was an early morning in <span class="country"></span> and
        <span class="name"></span> had a big presentation due for their job as a(n)  <span class="job"></span>.<br><br>
         <span class="name"></span> had printed everything out and decided in the meantime, to make some eggs and bacon. 
        They had even laid out their outfit, a <span class="color"> </span> suit.<br><br>
        <br><br>All the sudden <span class="name"> </span> heard a noise. It was their pet <span class="animal"> </span>
        named
        <span class="animalName"></span> chewing up the presentation! "Oh no! What will I do? I have to think quick!", said  <span class="name"></span>
       as they frantically finished their bacon and eggs. </div>
